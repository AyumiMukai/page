    <h1>Research Plan</h1>
    
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>Architects' spatial expressions are more diverse, subtle, polysemic, and dense than general expressions. In the doctoral research, we will focus on architects' unique figurative expressions that describe architectural space, and compare and analyze their spatial expressions depending on whether they are involved in the architectural industry or not. Through quantitative analysis of the subtlety of spatial expressions, the degree of divergence from general expressions and paraphrasing will be confirmed, aiming to help in the quantitative evaluation of architectural works.</p>
    
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <p>In this study, architectural images and descriptive words and phrases are extracted from descriptions of works (both English and Japanese) published in architectural magazines by designers and magazine editors.
The deviation from common expressions will be surveyed using crowdsourcing, targeting respondents from the architectural community and those who are not involved in the architectural industry. Respondents will be required to be native speakers of Japanese and C1 or higher on the CEFR (Common European Framework of Reference for Languages) for English.
The survey procedure is as follows,
  <ol>
  <li>First, we show the images of the works and ask the participants to select the degree to which they agree with some of the displayed words and phrases regarding the impression they receive from the images of the works. However, the words displayed should be words extracted from magazines and similar general expressions.</li>
  <li>Next, the subjects are asked to briefly describe any appropriate expressions other than the indicated words and phrases, and to answer the degree to which they apply. This is repeated for each subject on different sets of images.</li>
  </ol>
    From the questionnaire results, correlations between words are analyzed using multivariate analysis. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used as analysis methods. First, in the multidimensional scaling method, a positioning map was created to visually grasp the differences in images of architecture between the architectural community and the general public. Next, cluster analysis is used to group the data based on the degree of divergence between them and to examine replaceable expressions.
Based on the analysis results obtained in this study, we will explore methods to predict impressions of images of artworks.

    <h3>Outlook</h3>
    <p>I’m concerned about the possibility of fluctuation due to individual differences in the results of human questionnaires alone. Image generation AI such as ‘midjourney’, which has recently become popular, has learned from a vast number of architectural works, and I believe it can be a very effective tool for investigating the relationship
Research Plan between architectural images and linguistic expressions in a consistent manner. However, the tool may be "architecture-neighborhood-oriented" or "general-oriented" depending on what kind of teacher data is used to learn architectural linguistic expressions. So before using the tool, I need to consider the way of survey depending on it.</p>
